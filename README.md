Use USBtinyISP to read and write Microchip 25LCxx EEPROM devices

The software is written in Python and demonstrates use of PyUSB
using USBtiny as USB connected I/O device.

For schematics of USBtinyISP, see https://learn.adafruit.com/assets/6834

It would be wise to replace R7 and R4 with a lower value somewhere
around 500 ohms, as 1.5K may cause the clock signal distortion
to the point wher false clock pulses will be detected, depending
on your setup.
